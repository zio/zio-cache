title: "Cache Statistics"

ZIO Cache automatically tracks various statistics associated with the cache, such as the number of cache hits and misses, to allow you to assess the effectiveness of the cache. You can access these statistics by using the `cacheStats` operator on `Cache`.

```scala mdoc
import zio._

trait CacheStats {
  def hits: Long
  def misses: Long
}

trait Cache[-Key, +Error, +Value] {
  def cacheStats: UIO[CacheStats]
}
```

The cache statistics represent a snapshot as of a point in time. Note that the cache statistics are designed for aggregate analysis and may not be fully consistent.

More cache statistics will be added over time.
